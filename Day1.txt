1.Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

- HTTP stands for hypertext transfer protocol & it is used in client-server communication.
- By using HTTP , user sends the request to the server & the server sends the response to the user.

Drawbacks:
- HTTP/1.1 transfer all the requests & responses in the plain text message form.
- Head of line blocking in which TCP connection is blocked all other requests until the response does not receive. 
- All the information related to the header file is repeated in every request.

Advantages:
- HTTP/2 was developed over the SPDY protocol. 
- HTTP/2 works on the binary framing layer instead of textual that converts all the messages in binary format.
- HTTP/2 works on fully multiplexed that is one TCP connection is used for multiple requests. 
- HTTP/2 uses HPACK which is used to split data from header. it compresses the header. 
- The server sends all the other files like CSS & JS without the request of the client using the PUSH frame.

2. objects and its internal representation in Javascript

- Objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 
- These keys can be variables or functions and are called properties and methods, respectively, in the context of an object.
- Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. 
- That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. 
- The variables don’t actually store the value.

properties:

- A JavaScript object has properties associated with it. 
- A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object.
- Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, except for the attachment to objects.
- The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation:
- An object property name can be any valid JavaScript string, or anything that can be converted to a string, including the empty string.

creation of object:

using object literal, define the property and values inside curly braces.

let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

Create JavaScript Object with Constructor:

- Constructor is nothing but a function and with help of new keyword.
- constructor function allows to create multiple objects.

Using the JavaScript Keyword new :
The following example also creates a new JavaScript object with four properties:

Example:

var person = new Object();
person.firstName = “John”;
person.lastName = “Doe”;
person.age = 50;
person.eyeColor = “blue”;
